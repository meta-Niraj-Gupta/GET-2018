NORMALIZATION

Functional Dependency (FD)
FD depicts relationship between attributes.
It is expressed as A -> B or A determines B.
Trivial FD: X -> Y & Y is a subset of X.
Non Trivial FD: X -> Y & Y is not a subset of X.

Normalization
It is a process if organizing the data to reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity.
It ensures optimum structure.
It ensures atomic data.
It eliminates data inconsistencies & anomalies (update, insert & delete).

First Normal Form (1NF)
A relation is in 1NF if there are no repeating groups at the intersection of each row & column that means values at the intersection of each row and column is atomic.

Second Normal Form (2NF)
To be in second normal form, a relation must be in 1NF and relation must not contain any partial dependency.
If proper subset of candidate key determines non-prime attribute, it is called partial dependency.

Third Normal Form (3NF)
A relation is in third normal form, if there is no transitive dependency for non-prime attributes is it is in second normal form.
A relation is in 3NF if at least one of the following condition holds in every non-trivial function dependency X –> Y
X is a super key.
Y is a prime attribute (each element of Y is part of some candidate key).
